# WorldVLN: Autoregressive World Action Model for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation


This repository provides the reference implementation for WorldVLN. It includes an autoregressive inference for closed-loop action prediction, as well as two-stage training pipelines: (1) supervised backbone and action decoder training, and (2) action-aware GRPO–based optimization.

## Installation

We recommend using a single Python 3.10 environment for the released workflows. In our validated launch scripts, the Python interpreter is passed explicitly through `PYTHON_BIN`, so after activating your environment it is recommended to export:

```bash
export PYTHON_BIN=$(which python)
```

### Recommended Environment

1. Create a Python 3.10 environment.

```bash
conda create -n worldvln python=3.10
conda activate worldvln
```

2. Install a PyTorch build that matches your CUDA environment. For the released training and action-aware GRPO workflows, a PyTorch 2.5.1 environment is the recommended baseline.

3. Install the shared dependencies used by the released workflows.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

### Model Weights

Official WorldVLN weights are available on Hugging Face:

- [WorldVLN weights](https://huggingface.co/EmbodiedCity/WorldVLN)

Download the weights to your preferred checkpoint directory and configure the relevant training or inference scripts to point to them.

Simulation / benchmark resources:

- IndoorUAV simulation environment download guide: [Indoor_UAV](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/valyentine/Indoor_UAV)
- UAV-Flow benchmark and evaluation environment: [buaa-colalab/UAV-Flow](https://github.com/buaa-colalab/UAV-Flow)

## Inference

The repository currently provides two main inference entry points.

### Online Inference Service

#### Quick start

From the repository root:

```bash
export PYTHON_BIN=$(which python)
export INFINITY_CKPT=/path/to/infinity/global_step_xxx.pth
export STAGE2_LATENT2ACTION_CKPT=/path/to/stage2_latent2action_combined.pt

bash infer/run_server.sh
```

Common environment variables:

- `INFINITY_CKPT`: main InfinityStar / WorldVLN checkpoint used by the service
- `STAGE2_LATENT2ACTION_CKPT`: Stage-2 latent-to-action checkpoint for action prediction
- `INFINITY_SERVER_CONFIG`: optional override for `infer/config.json`
- `INFINITY_REPO_ROOT`: optional override for the default `Worldmodel/runtime/`
- `INFINITY_LATENT_CACHE_ROOT`: runtime cache directory used by the service
- `HOST`, `PORT`: bind address for Uvicorn

#### Details

- Entry points: [infer/run_server.sh](./infer/run_server.sh), [infer/server.py](./infer/server.py)
- Configuration: [infer/config.json](./infer/config.json)
- Windows-side client: [infer/client.py](./infer/client.py)

#### Autoregressive I/O contract (how clients talk to the server)

WorldVLN runs in an **autoregressive** closed-loop protocol over a trajectory `session_id`:

- **Input (per call)**: `images_base64` (RGB frames) + an optional `instruction` on the first call.
  - First call typically sends **1 warmup frame**.
  - Next calls send **`step` frames** (default 16) to advance the session timeline.
- **State (server-side)**: the server stores history by `session_id` and maintains a streaming world-model session.
- **Output (per call)**: `actions` as delta actions in **cm/deg** with order `[dx, dy, dz, droll, dyaw, dpitch]`.
  - In the default `tsformer_latent` mode, the server emits **one segment worth of actions** whenever enough frames have been received.

Example (strict closed-loop, enable `allow_future_segments=1`):

- Send **(1 real frame + instruction/prompt)** → get the next **`step` actions** (typically 16).
- Execute them, collect the next **`step` real frames**, send them → get the next **`step` actions**.
- Repeat with the same `session_id` until the trajectory ends.

Clients in this repo follow the same pattern:

- **`infer/client.py`** (simulation / dataset example): sends `1, step, step, ...` frames under a stable `session_id`, and writes per-segment `*_actions.json` / `*_poses.json`.
- **`action_aware_grpo/windows_client.py`** (Windows-side rollout integration / debugging): uses the same session protocol and output format, but is packaged as a Win-friendly client for action-aware GRPO workflows.

## Training

This repository is organized into two stages:

- **Stage 1 (supervised)**: backbone finetuning + action decoder training.
- **Stage 2 (action-aware GRPO)**: rollout collection + GRPO training.

### Stage 1: Supervised Training

#### Backbone Training

#### Quick start

```bash
bash train/scripts/train_from_base.sh
```

#### Details

The backbone finetuning workflow is located under [train/](./train).

- Entry point: [train/scripts/train_from_base.sh](./train/scripts/train_from_base.sh)
- Main trainer: [train/train.py](./train/train.py)
- Detailed guide: [train/TRAINING.md](./train/TRAINING.md)

#### Action Decoder Training

#### Quick start (Stage A + Stage B)

```bash
# Stage A: adapter distillation
bash train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageA_ddp.sh

# Stage B: latent-to-action training
bash train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageB_ddp.sh
```

#### Details

The action decoder workflow is located under [Worldmodel/action_decoder/src/](./Worldmodel/action_decoder/src) and is organized into two steps (Stage A + Stage B).

The action decoder training entrypoints live under [train/action_decoder/](./train/action_decoder) and are organized into two steps:

- Stage A adapter distillation: [train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageA_ddp.sh](./train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageA_ddp.sh)
- Stage B latent-to-action training: [train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageB_ddp.sh](./train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageB_ddp.sh)
- Main scripts: [train/action_decoder/tools/train_stageA_ddp.py](./train/action_decoder/tools/train_stageA_ddp.py), [train/action_decoder/tools/train_stageB_ddp.py](./train/action_decoder/tools/train_stageB_ddp.py)

This workflow trains the mapping from visual latent features to 6-DoF motion outputs.

Data contract (training manifest):

```json
{
  "items_train": [
    {
      "latent_path": "path/to/latents.pt",
      "traj_json_path": "path/to/preprocessed_logs.json",
      "images_dir": "path/to/images"
    }
  ]
}
```

Stage A required environment variables:

- `MANIFEST_JSON`
- `TSFORMER_CKPT`
- `INF_VAE_PATH`

Run Stage A:

```bash
bash train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageA_ddp.sh
```

Stage B required environment variables:

- `MANIFEST_JSON`
- `TSFORMER_PRETRAINED`
- `ADAPTER_CKPT`
- `INFINITYSTAR_VAE_PATH`

Run Stage B:

```bash
bash train/action_decoder/scripts/train_stageB_ddp.sh
```

### Stage 2: Action-aware GRPO

bash action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stagea_collect.sh RUN_ID=remote_sim_smoke TOP_N=1 K_CAND=1 STAGEA_NPROC=1 STAGEA_PROGRESS_EVERY_N=1
```

Run train (partial-freeze optimization):

```bash
CHECKPOINTS_DIR=/path/to/checkpointsinf \
RUSH_RESUME=/path/to/infinity/global_step_xxx.pth \
REPLAY_META_DIR=/path/to/replay_meta_rollout_smoke \
bash action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stageb_partialfreeze.sh PARTIAL_FREEZE_MODE=smoke RUN_ID=stageb_smoke
```

#### Details

The action-aware GRPO workflow is located under [action_aware_grpo/](./action_aware_grpo) and is organized into two steps: **rollout** and **train**.

- Server entry point: [action_aware_grpo/grpo_server.py](./action_aware_grpo/grpo_server.py)
- Windows-side client (for action-aware GRPO rollout integration / debugging): [action_aware_grpo/windows_client.py](./action_aware_grpo/windows_client.py)
- Rollout collection: [action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stagea_collect.sh](./action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stagea_collect.sh)
- Train (partial-freeze optimization): [action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stageb_partialfreeze.sh](./action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_stageb_partialfreeze.sh)
- Remote simulator service wrapper: [action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_remote_sim_service.sh](./action_aware_grpo/scripts/run_remote_sim_service.sh)
- Local inference launcher used by rollout: [action_aware_grpo/run_infer_server.sh](./action_aware_grpo/run_infer_server.sh)

At a high level:

- Rollout consumes rollout sources and model assets, then generates rollout caches and replay metadata.
- Train consumes replay metadata and runs optimization to produce updated checkpoints and logs.
